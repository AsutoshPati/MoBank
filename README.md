# Mo Bank - Dummy Banking System App

### Overview:
"**Mo Bank**" is a comprehensive dummy banking system app developed as an educational tool for students to learn Python 
programming. This project focuses on providing hands-on experience in GUI interfacing using the PyQt module, along with 
essential concepts like database management and file handling in Python. Through simulation, "Mo Bank" emulates various 
banking functions, fostering a dynamic learning environment for users.

### Key Features:
- #### GUI Interfacing with PyQt:
    Utilizes the **PyQt** module to create an interactive and user-friendly graphical interface. Offers a seamless 
experience for users, ensuring ease of navigation through banking functionalities.

- #### Banking Functions Simulation:
    Simulates fundamental banking operations:
    - Money deposit
    - Withdrawal
    - Fund transfer
    - Account statement generation

- #### User Roles:
    Introduces different user roles to replicate real-world banking scenarios.
    Roles include:
    - Customer
    - Bank Staff (Single Window Operator)
    - Administrator
  
  <br>
  
  During the first run application creates an Administrator with mobile number ```9999999999``` and password 
  ```Hello@123```. To add a new user login using any Administrator and under **Admin** section choose **New Customer**
  and enter the details.

  <br>
  
  To update the user role visit **Update Customer** under **Admin** section.

- #### Database Management:
    Implements database (**SQLite**) functionality to store and retrieve user account information securely. Ensures the integrity and
reliability of user data through effective database management.

- #### File Handling:
    Demonstrates Python's file handling capabilities for tasks such as logging and data storage. Provides insights into 
efficient file handling practices in a banking system.
